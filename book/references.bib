  abstract = {It is often assumed that cellular and synaptic properties need to be regulated to specific values to allow a neuronal network to function properly. To determine how tightly neuronal properties and synaptic strengths need to be tuned to produce a given network output, we simulated more than 20 million versions of a three-cell model of the pyloric network of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion using different combinations of synapse strengths and neuron properties. We found that virtually indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate sets of underlying mechanisms, suggesting that there could be considerable animal-to-animal variability in many of the parameters that control network activity, and that many different combinations of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane properties can be consistent with appropriate network performance.},

  abstract = {Cortical long-term plasticity depends on firing rate, spike timing, and cooperativity among inputs, but how these factors interact during realistic patterns of activity is unknown. Here we monitored plasticity while systematically varying the rate, spike timing, and number of coincident afferents. These experiments demonstrate a novel form of cooperativity operating even when postsynaptic firing is evoked by current injection, and reveal a complex dependence of LTP and LTD on rate and timing. Based on these data, we constructed and tested three quantitative models of cortical plasticity. One of these models, in which spike-timing relationships causing LTP "win" out over those favoring LTD, closely fits the data and accurately predicts the build-up of plasticity during random firing. This provides a quantitative framework for predicting the impact of in vivo firing patterns on synaptic strength.},
