## Course description
Through exploitaiton of this model yyou will dive deeper into the principles of neuronal connectivity: what are the different means by which neurons can be connected within networks, and how does such coupling affect the membrane properties and activity pattern of the individual cell and how can the performance of a circuit changed?

## Learning outcomes
* Explain how neurons can be connected to each other and how such coupling impacts on the properties of the individual cell and the behaviour of a neuronal circuit, with emphasis on the effect on different membrane proteins
* Describe the principles underlying computational models of neuronal circuits.
