## Course description
Through exploitaiton of this model you will dive deeper into the principles of neuronal connectivity: what are the different means by which neurons can be connected within networks, and how does such coupling affect the membrane properties and activity pattern of the individual cell and how can the performance of a circuit be changed?

## Learning outcomes
* Explain how neurons can be connected to each other and how such coupling impacts on the properties of the individual cell and the behaviour of a neuronal circuit, with emphasis on the effect on neuron identity, connectivity and activity.
* Describe the principles underlying computational models of neuronal circuits and understand the advantages of using a adapting spiking neuron model to better understand circuit function.
