# 1.Neurons and motifs

In this lab, we will introduce the idea of computational modeling. A model is the abstraction of the actual physical world. To study the brain function, the modern approach is to abstract the computation properties of the brain. In other words, we treat the brain as a specialized computation device in computational neuroscience.

## Abstraction
Which level of abstraction to use and which property to retain depend on the question we want to ask about a system. Taking a car for instance, ...

## Computation
The computational property of the brain simply means what arithmetic or non-arithmetic operations the brain can perform. In general, the brain receives external sensory information, processes the information withn internal dynamics, and finally produces actions. It is a computation device that is highly autonomous and coupled with the environment. The goal of computational neuroscience is to understand *what* kind of operations are performed by the brain, *how* are they performed, and *why* are they performed.

In the following sections, we will build models from a single neuron, to a small motif, and finally to an STG network.
